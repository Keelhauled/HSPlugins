## Description
A random bunch of plugin mods for Honey Select.  
Use ModMenuManager to change your current hotkeys/settings for the mods.  
Feel free to remove the xml files related to mods you don't use.

If you've found a bug or think something could be improved with any of my mods please make a github issue or a hongfire comment about it or message me on the Honey Play discord.

## Plugins

#### BetterSceneLoader - [Download](https://github.com/Keelhauled/HSPlugins/releases/download/v1.0.0/BetterSceneLoader.zip)
Faster to use scene loader for Studio Neo.
Scenes are loaded from `\UserData\studioneo\BetterSceneLoader`.  
The subfolders of this folder will act as categories for your scenes.  
`order.txt` in the aforementioned folder can be used to customize the order of the categories in the dropdown menu.  
All the necessary folders and files are created after running the game once.  
*ModMenuManager is required to use this*.

#### HideUI - [Download](https://github.com/Keelhauled/HSPlugins/releases/download/v1.0.0/HideUI.zip)
Hide all the UI with one click, hotkey is `M` by default.  
More menus can be added in `\Plugins\InterfaceSuite\HideUI.txt`.

#### LightManager - [Download](https://github.com/Keelhauled/HSPlugins/releases/download/v1.0.0/LightManager.zip)
Currently the only use is making spotlights track characters.  
To use, first select the lights you want to target and then select a character and press apply in the anim menu.  
Importing a scene doesn't do anything at the moment.  
*[HSExtSave](http://www.hongfire.com/forum/forum/hentai-lair/hf-modding-translation/honey-select-mods/5747804) is required to use this*.

#### ModMenuManager - [Download](https://github.com/Keelhauled/HSPlugins/releases/download/v1.0.0/ModMenuManager.zip)
A menu to manage all other mod menus.  
Menus can be added or removed in `\Plugins\InterfaceSuite\ModMenuManager\ModMenuManager.xml`.

#### ModSettingsMenu - [Download](https://github.com/Keelhauled/HSPlugins/releases/download/v1.0.0/ModSettingsMenu.zip)
An "easily" customizable in-game settings menu for mods.  
Settings can be added or removed in `\Plugins\InterfaceSuite\ModSettingsMenu`.  
*ModMenuManager is required to use this*.

#### TogglePOV - [Download](https://github.com/Keelhauled/HSPlugins/releases/download/v1.0.0/TogglePOV.zip)
The original and the best POV mod for Honey Select improved and updated for the latest version.  
In an hscene the selected chara is the one that is closest to the cameratarget when pressing the button.  
Right mouse button can be used to change the FOV while in first person mode.  
Default hotkey is `Backspace`.  
Core code not written by me.
